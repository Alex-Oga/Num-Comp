Variables
 - Containers for storing data values
 - Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set
 - Variable names are case-sensitive
Variable names
 - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
 - A variable name cannot start with a number
 - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
 - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Indentation
 - Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose
